# Aptos AI Roulette - Technical Overview

## Project Overview

Aptos AI Roulette is an innovative blockchain-based roulette game that combines the security and transparency of the Aptos blockchain with cutting-edge AI technology. The game features a unique AI virtual host powered by Google's Gemini API, providing an immersive and interactive gaming experience. Spin, win, and be amazed by the future of decentralized gaming!

## Architecture

### 1. Smart Contract (Move)

The game's core logic is implemented in Move, Aptos's native programming language. Key features include:

- **Game State Management**: Tracks house balance, game status, and events
- **Betting System**:
  - Minimum bet: 0.01 APT
  - Numbers range: 0-36
  - Provably fair outcomes using Aptos's random number generation
- **Event System**: Records bet placements and spin results on-chain
- **Security Features**: Input validation, balance checks, and pause functionality

#### Smart Contract Functions

- `initialize_game`: Sets up initial game state
- `place_bet`: Processes player bets
- `spin_wheel`: Generates random outcome
- `payout_winners`: Handles prize distribution
- `emergency_withdraw`: Allows recovery of funds in critical situations
- `update_house_edge`: Adjusts house edge parameter via governance

### 2. Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)

The user interface is built with modern web technologies:

- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Real-time game updates and animations
- Wallet integration (Petra & Martian)
- Interactive betting interface
- Real-time voice interactions
- Progressive loading for AI-generated assets

### 3. Backend Integration

- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for the virtual host
  - Response caching system for common interactions
  - Fallback mechanism for service unavailability
  - Context-aware conversation management
- **Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs API for realistic voice interactions
- **WebSocket**: Real-time game state updates with reconnection logic
- **Redis Cache**: For frequently accessed data and session management

## Game Flow

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Players connect using either Petra or Martian wallet
   - Account balance verification

2. **Betting Phase** - Player selects a number (0-36)
   - Places bet (minimum 0.01 APT)
   - Bet is recorded on-chain via smart contract

3. **Game Execution**
   - Random number generation using Aptos's secure RNG and commit-reveal scheme
   - Smart contract validates and processes the outcome
   - Results are recorded as blockchain events

4. **AI Host Interaction**
   - Virtual host provides real-time commentary
   - Voice synthesis for immersive experience
   - Dynamic responses based on game events

## Security Measures

- **Smart Contract Security**:
  - Formal verification of critical functions
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Rate limiting to prevent spam attacks
  - Multi-signature requirements for administrative actions

- **User Security**:
  - Secure wallet integrations
  - Transaction confirmation flows
  - Clear error messaging

- **Infrastructure Security**:
  - Protected API endpoints
  - DDoS protection
  - Regular security audits

## AI Integration Details

### Virtual Host Capabilities

- Real-time natural language processing
- Context-awareness of player history and game state
- Personalized interactions based on player behavior
- Voice synthesis for immersive experience

### AI Image Generation

- **Celebratory Images**: Custom-generated visuals to commemorate significant wins
- **Consolation Cards**: Personalized "better luck next time" visuals
- **Dynamic Environments**: Casino backgrounds that evolve based on winning streaks
- **Player Avatars**: AI-generated custom avatars for personal profiles

### Upcoming AI Host Agent Features

The following features will be implemented in the coming days:

* **Win Celebrations**: AI-generated celebratory images that dynamically respond to the size and type of win
* **Personalized Loss Cards**: Custom "better luck next time" visuals tailored to the player's betting style and history
* **Dynamic Casino Environments**: Background scenery that evolves based on the player's winning streak, creating a more immersive experience

## Performance Optimizations

- WebSocket batching for high-frequency updates
- Lazy loading of non-critical assets
- AI response caching for common interactions
- Optimistic UI updates with blockchain confirmation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-token Support**: Accept multiple cryptocurrencies beyond APT
2. **Multiplayer Rooms**: Private and public game rooms with social features
3. **Tournament Mode**: Competitive gameplay with leaderboards
4. **Enhanced AI Interactions**: More sophisticated conversational capabilities
5. **Additional Betting Options**: Expanded bet types beyond single numbers
6. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android
7. **VR Integration**: Virtual reality casino environment
