The game features a unique AI virtual host powered by Google's Gemini API, providing an immersive and interactive gaming experience. Spin, win, and be amazed by the future of decentralized gaming!

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. 📜 Smart Contract (Move)

The game's core logic is implemented in Move, Aptos's native programming language. Key features include:

- **🔄 Game State Management**: Tracks house balance, game status, and events
- **💰 Betting System**:
  - Minimum bet: 0.01 APT
  - Numbers range: 0-36
  - Provably fair outcomes using Aptos's random number generation
- **📝 Event System**: Records bet placements and spin results on-chain
- **🔒 Security Features**: Input validation, balance checks, and pause functionality

#### ⚙️ Smart Contract Functions

- `initialize_game`: Sets up initial game state
- `place_bet`: Processes player bets
- `spin_wheel`: Generates random outcome
- `payout_winners`: Handles prize distribution
- `emergency_withdraw`: Allows recovery of funds in critical situations
- `update_house_edge`: Adjusts house edge parameter via governance

### 2. 🖥️ Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)

The user interface is built with modern web technologies:

- 📱 Responsive design optimized for all devices
- ⚡ Real-time game updates and animations
- 👛 Wallet integration (Petra & Martian)
- 🎮 Interactive betting interface
- 🗣️ Real-time voice interactions
- 🔄 Progressive loading for AI-generated assets

### 3. 🔌 Backend Integration
